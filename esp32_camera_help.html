ESP32 Camera application suports up to four modules. The camera module and the phone must be on the same wireless local network. 
If the camera module uses default face recognition sketch, the url address for streaming in the application must be set to: http://cameraIP:81/stream (for example: http://192.168.1.123:81/stream). To change resolution of the camera module, enter the camera IP adress in the web browser (for example: http://192.168.1.123), not in the application settings, because there is not java script support.
