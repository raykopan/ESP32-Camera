    ESP32 Camera suports up to 4 video cameras. The camera module and the phone must be on the same wireless network. 
    If the camera module uses default face recognition sketch, the url address for streaming in the application must be set to: http://cameraIP:81/stream (for example: http://192.168.1.123:81/stream). To change resolution of the camera module, enter the camera IP adress in the web browser (for example: http://192.168.1.123), not in the application, because there is not java script support .
